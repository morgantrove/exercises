        "content":"The Chatham Street Chowdown food truck rally in downtown  <icent id=\"4017253\"> Cary </icent>  is growing in a big way.  The town announced there will be 24 food trucks at the next food truck event Sunday, July 26, from 5 to 9:30 p.m. That’s up from the 15 trucks that spread out along West Chatham Street in April.  Because of the high interest from area trucks, the footprint for the event will be bigger, said Ashley McCall, cultural arts program assistant for the Town of  <icent id=\"4017253\"> Cary </icent> .  The event will stretch across Chatham Street, starting at Harrison Avenue, crossing Academy Street, and extending to Walker Street.  The lineup includes many trucks making their first appearance at the Chatham Street Chowdown, including Cousins Maine Lobster , which has become popular in the Triangle food truck scene.  The trucks scheduled to attend are: American Meltdown , Baguettaboutit , Bam Pow Chow , Belgian Waffle Crafters (formerly known as Belgian Waffology), Chick-N-Que , Chirba Chirba Dumpling , CJ’s Street Food , Green Olive Deli , Gussy’s Greek Food , Hibachi XPress , Philly’s Cheesesteaks , Pie Pushers , RedEye Barbeque , Rolling Bistro , Sarge’s , The Wandering Moose , Virgil’s  <icent id=\"4000113\"> Jamaica </icent>  and Will and Pops .  There also will be a beer and wine garden with Brueprint Brewing Co. , Fortnight Brewing Co. , and Chatham Hill Winery .  Frozen treats and drinks will be represented by Locopops , SweetWater New York Ice. Co ., The Freezing Pointe and Fahsyrah’s Fresh Squeezed Lemonade . Plus, there will be Crossroads Kettle Corn Popcorn .  Scarlet and Peak City Sound are scheduled to perform.  Chatham Street will be closed from 2 to 10:30 p.m. Walker Street and Harrison Avenue will remain accessible.  The town also notes that The  <icent id=\"4017253\"> Cary </icent>  theater on East Chatham Street will offer up a slate of foodie films in the week leading up to the food truck rally. Starting Sunday, July 19, the offerings include “Chocolat,” “Like Water for Chocolate” and “Mystic Pizza.”  On Sunday, July 26, at 2 p.m., the day of the food truck rally, “Chef,” a film about food trucks, will be shown at 2 p.m.",

We are notorious for eating on the run, a characteristic we don't appreciate until a visit to a city like  <icent id=\"4000259\"> Tokyo </icent>  where walking and eating in public is practically illegal.   <icent id=\"4016748\"> New York City </icent>  has a deep history of street food vending, from the original local fare of oysters and clams to the romanticized pushcarts of the Lower East Side. Waves of early European immigrants broadened the offerings to include pickles, sausages, knishes and corn. It is estimated that in the early 1900's there were thousands of street food carts in the city.  The emergence of food trucks paralleled the evolving cart culture. Their genesis traced to the western chuck wagons of the late 1800's and then to a more urban setting with the lunch wagon. These lunch trucks and food carts sold either food already prepared or had on-board facilities where operators prepared meals from scratch. If we have a favorite memory of a local greasy spoon or a long gone lunch counter, then how about a recollection of the legendary roach coach with its bitter coffee and plastic wrapped/plastic tasting food? It was the iconic food symbol of construction sites or transient neighborhoods with fluctuating street traffic.  What New Yorker cannot remember the true sound of summer? The jingle of the neighborhood Mr. Softie in the early evening is indelibly etched in the early folklore of ice cream trucks. As for my truly favorite food, dirty water dogs (I cannot remember how many I ate in my economically lean years), they are fast, cheap and delicious.  Surprisingly, over the past 10 years, food trucks became trendy, gourmet and a choice destination for a meal. They were flash points of conflict between their operators and bricks-and-mortar landlords. They went beyond an option for enterprising individuals and nurtured entrepreneurial dreams of would-be restaurateurs, chefs and food aficionados. While they were always an option for unskilled (though food savvy) labor, the new generation of carts and trucks unleashed a wealth of ethnic food diversity and offered myriad benefits: employment, higher quality food options in broader communities and a stepping stone to other potential jobs in the culinary world.  The force behind this major shift in mobile food culture is the convergence of several forces:  •The recession closed many high-end restaurants and chefs/cooks were looking for new work options. Diners were interested in more casual and cheaper food options as well.  •Social media made it fun and easy to track the location of food trucks adding cache to dining experience.  •KogiBBQ in  <icent id=\"4003658\"> Los Angeles </icent>  (serving Korean favorites like short rib tacos with kimchi, and Kogi sliders or dogs) is credited as the first truck to gain widespread recognition and inspire a succession of other ethnic food trucks, from Indian to Vietnamese and  <icent id=\"4186680\"> Brazilian </icent>  to  <icent id=\"4258348\"> Greek </icent>  and Middle-Eastern -- not to mention upscale ice cream trucks, vegan, or cupcake and waffles concepts. The list is endless.  •We love eating out and discovering new options. Over the past 10 years, we have watched the emergence of an experiential food dining culture. The food truck phenomenon has both fed this trend while it's been fed by it at the same time. Once  <icent id=\"4026905\"> Hollywood </icent>  grasped the storyline, the country followed. The Great Food Truck Race on The  <icent id=\"4258754\"> Food Network </icent>  was a hit. \"Chef,\" the movie, romanticized the struggle of a frustrated and talented chef who found fame and fortune (and love) behind the wheel of a nomadic food truck.  Now the reality: trucks are expensive and it is all about a good working vehicle. Truck breakdown or cooking equipment malfunction means loss of revenue. Regulations are formidable. To operate a truck, you need to pass a course on  <icent id=\"4260452\"> food safety </icent>  and vehicle regulations. You need licenses and insurance as well as a depot/commissary for nightly upkeep and resupply. To take a truck onto the street, it first needs to pass rigorous inspection and then you need a permit; only the catch is that the city is not issuing unrestricted permits. The city's mobile vending laws were last updated in 1965, when a first-class postage stamp was 5 cents. Restricted permits are easier to get once the operator has a contract with a site that is willing to allow a food truck to operate on its premise. Hence, the interest in contracts at regulated destinations such as Governors Island, designated parks, private property, etc.  For every diner who looks for the lobster roll truck, there is a resentful restaurant owner -- angry that the truck has no rent or overhead, and might poach his/her customers. Of course, trucks have real operating costs but their flexibility is enviable compared to a long-term lease. Trucks bring vibrancy to neighborhoods, while creating community and entertainment. The NYC Food Truck Association seeks to bridge the gap in the hospitality world and regulation landscape by bringing together truck operators,  <icent id=\"4260849\"> local government </icent> ,  <icent id=\"4260071\"> community organizations </icent>  and the public. One of its goals is to \"Promote community-oriented vending behavior to ensure food trucks are operating as good citizens.\"  Here's my confession. I had a bad case of food truck envy. In 2010 I had contract food clients in Wave Hill in Riverdale who closed their café while they renovated the historic building that housed it. I jumped at the chance to offer them a food truck for a two-year period. Thus, the Katchkie Veggie Truck was born, inspired by our farm and our love for vegetables and  <icent id=\"4260626\"> healthy eating </icent> . We rolled it out at a Zagat food truck event where I received lesson #1. People line up for delicious food -- but vegetables come in last. There are lines for sliders, souvalaki, dim sum, ice cream, pizza, any form of pork, even greasy mac n' cheese -- but rarely for veggie burgers. Last year we successfully bid on placement of a food truck at Governors Island, putting that lesson to work. The Dog House , a pint-sized converted Cushman Truckster, is at the food court every weekend selling designer hot dogs and becoming a destination in its own right.  The annual Vendy Awards are the Oscars of the food truck world. Held in September, they feature close to 20 trucks competing in several 'Best of' categories. This and other food truck rallies from  <icent id=\"4016698\"> Montauk </icent>  to El Barrio provide opportunities to spend an afternoon eating from truck to truck.  There are trucks with social missions like Snowday Food Truck from Drive Change, an organization dedicated to helping formerly incarcerated youth find employment, learn skills and establish new lives. The Cinnamon Snail , currently off-line as a result of the permitting situation, achieved a giant following and awards, with its all-vegan menu. In fact, many trucks are dedicated to serving healthful and locally-sourced ingredients.  The regulatory landscape for food trucks merits revision. These trucks are essentially  <icent id=\"4261328\"> small businesses </icent> , subject to a lot of regulation on top of the challenges of operating on the street. Small businesses are the heart of our country, employing vast numbers of workers, providing entry level opportunities, nurturing entrepreneurial dreams, being incubators of creativity, all while feeding and even educating us about cuisine and the marvelous array of individuals behind the window & wheel. As for my mobile vehicle wish list, there are a few concepts on the drawing board -- from the Chicken Coop to the Pickle Barrel. However, I am not giving up my day job.

        "content":"The City of  <icent id=\"4000797\"> Amsterdam </icent>  is set to embark on a food truck pilot project, which will allow culinary entrepreneurs to operate multiple food trucks at a number of pre-designated locations for a period of two years.  A total of 50 innovative entrepreneurs are set to participate in the pilot, with mobile kitchens given the green light to serve up their dishes at 24 locations throughout the city. Alderperson for Economic Affairs Kajsa Ollongren will hand out the first permits on Monday 29 June.  The trial will provide opportunities for innovative food concepts to flourish in places where the street food offering is currently scarce, as well as adding to Amsterdam’s culinary diversity. One of the criteria for participating in the pilot was that the new food on offer should differ from the street food already sold in  <icent id=\"4000797\"> Amsterdam </icent> , such as fries, herring, ice cream and hot dogs.  In addition, the sustainability and healthiness of the proposed foods were important criteria for the selection committee. The selected entrepreneurs will work within a rotation system so that each location can be visited by different trucks on a given day. This ensures that each of the 24 locations will enjoy a varied selection of street food. The pilot will be evaluated after two years, and a decision will subsequently be made regarding whether to continue the project.   <icent id=\"4257234\"> Apple TV </icent>  to launch in  <icent id=\"4000158\"> the Netherlands </icent>  next week  Dutch DJ and Producer Afrojack Announces \"Jacked\" Tour Dates Across North America  Unique and Outrageous Way to Support the Dutch Olympic Team  Amsterdam to organise royal boat parade on 30 April",

In spite of, or because of, this cultural fusion, Tako comes together as something that's unique for the city -- and it works. Even though it is the smallest among sibling restaurants Butcher and the  <icent id=\"4016929\"> Rye </icent>  and Meat & Potatoes, it debuted with an energy that's impossible to ignore.  Who would have thought a couple of years ago that one of the most anticipated restaurants of the season would open on a street across from Heinz Hall? Sure, Tako isn't for everyone. Your stately uncle would appreciate it less than your youngest sister who just graduated from college.  Hours: 5 to 11 p.m., bar until 1 a.m., Tuesday to Thursday; dinner 5 p.m. to midnight, bar until 2 a.m., Friday and Saturday; closed Sunday and Monday.  Basics: Tako serves memorable cocktails along with captivating renditions of taqueria fare with Asian-inspired influences.  Dishes: Build your own guacamole; street corn; beet tostada; kale; thrice cooked wings; papa bravas; chorizo tacos; al pastor tacos; baja tacos.  Prices: Starters $7 to $14; tacos $10 to $14. .  But if you care about visiting one of the city's most talked-about restaurants, if you're loosey-goosey about the cultural origins of a dish, if you like dressed-up street food, and if you've found yourself following bartenders as they change venues, then Tako is your kind of place.  It would be smart to make a reservation, since Tako gets crowded. And it very likely won't be a quiet dining experience, with a lively playlist and rising volume as the night progresses. But Tako is worth a visit for many reasons, but especially because of the attention to details, right down to the availability of Topo Chico Mineral Water, a south-of-the-border cult favorite.  Such focus reassures that menu items beyond booze get equal treatment, which isn't always the case at Butcher and the  <icent id=\"4016929\"> Rye </icent>  or Meat & Potatoes. And the service is great to boot, carried out by a staff that knows its stuff, especially David Racicot, chef de cuisine and  <icent id=\"4187970\"> James Beard </icent>  semifinalist in 2009 and 2011. In the late 2000s Mr. Racicot was largely credited with steering  <icent id=\"4178381\"> Fayette County </icent> 's Lautrec restaurant at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort to its AAA Five-Diamond, Forbes Five-Star status.  Tako reinforces Mr. DeShantz's passion for design and whimsy. A yellow letter board ablaze with marquee lights beckons with the promise of tacos, poke and rum pie. Inside by the entrance, a rainbow of alphabet magnets spell out the day's tacos on a steel wall. Gothic chandeliers are fashioned from bike chains, while faux boxwood serves as wallpaper upstairs. In an homage to the name, a mural of an octopus with a pinup girl in a tentacled stronghold looks like a giant tattoo.  As demonstrated by the popularity of Sienna Mercato's open design and rooftop dining in its three-level space on Penn Avenue, Tako also brings diners outside. The best seats in the house are the bar stools mounted along the sidewalk, aligning a vast window that allows diners to become a part of the open kitchen.  \"I designed it to emphasize the street and street food,\" said Mr. DeShantz. \"I want to give it the feel of a food truck.\" To reinforce the point, on the dining room side, the kitchen is walled off by glass.  The menu references  <icent id=\"4181084\"> Asia </icent>  and  <icent id=\"4181090\"> Latin America </icent>  with Hawaiian poke, Korean tacos, Tex-Mex queso fundido, as well as tacos stuffed with carnitas and bistec. But the Latin-Asian interplay is more pronounced in the drinks, with Presidente ($4.50) from the  <icent id=\"4000064\"> Dominican Republic </icent> ,  <icent id=\"4000423\"> Tecate </icent>  ($4) from  <icent id=\"4016677\"> Mexico </icent> , Tiger ($5) from  <icent id=\"4000202\"> Singapore </icent>  and Hitachino ($12) from  <icent id=\"4000114\"> Japan </icent> .  Speaking of libations, the drinks from managers Spencer Warren and Maggie Meskey are worth a visit alone. The menu is a list of high and low cocktails, from a saucy el diablo, a classic cocktail with Sauza  <icent id=\"4022894\"> Blanco </icent>  tequila, lime, ginger, soda water and cassis ($10), to a selection of frozen margaritas ($10).  For a small place, there are lots of menus here. The build-your-own guac menu is made for millennials, a Chipotle-fied list of hot to haute ingredients with $1 items (shishito peppers, cotija cheese, pineapple), $3 items (bacon, chorizo), $4 items (tuna, crabmeat, pork belly, duck confit) and free stuff such as dill, togarashi, soy, pepitas, and an outlier's favorite, pickled mustard seeds. Chips are homemade, served in what looks like a cigar box, thin and salty and crispy, beside a melon-sized mound of green filled with mix-ins.  Among starters, the vegetables are dolled up. A cob of street corn ($6) wears a froth of mayonnaise, chili, lime and cotija cheese, as messy as it is served at a street festival in  <icent id=\"4027132\"> Brooklyn </icent> ,  <icent id=\"4001468\"> N.Y. </icent>  A beet tostada ($7) is touted as \"beets pretending to be beef,\" served with a foam of fromage blanc, lemon vinaigrette and avocado on a homemade tortilla.  Kale ($8) gets an Asian treatment with mustard greens, dashi-braised daikon, miso vinaigrette and sesame, layered to please your favorite yoga instructor. Papa (sic) bravas ($8) is less complex, a plate of confit potatoes with garlic aioli, tomato sauce, sea salt and oregano. Like this dish, some starters are over the top with fat, as if seasoned vegetables alone couldn't possibly satiate a diner; they must have mayonnaise. The same goes for the big eye tuna poke ($14), a bold play with seaweed, soy dressing, serrano peppers, crumbled rice cracker and whipped lime that's unnecessary.  Order thrice-cooked wings ($10) and you will be assaulted by the scent of caramelized fish sauce to make some of the best wings around. I'm surprised that the kitchen did not anticipate diners' reactions and nix it, though Mr. DeShantz said he has toned it down from the more pungent Vietnamese-style wings he loves. Even if they're as sticky as a  <icent id=\"4177447\"> Jolly Rancher </icent> , they're great, served with pickled carrots, chili and a garnish of chopped mint and cilantro.  Ceviche ($12) lies among the more delicate dishes, one of many that show the expertise in the kitchen, with razor-thin sliced fluke, tomato and minced onion, serranos, lime and a corn chip garnish.  The taco menu focuses on meats, between the chorizo, carnitas, bistec, al pastor and duck confit. The namesake tako ($12) is the most ambitious, with grilled octopus that arrives dressed in aioli laced with Tunisian harissa and preserved lemons along with mizuna greens, fried chickpeas and pickled red onion. I'm wary of harissa on a taco, but if you're not, this could be a favorite because of the deep char and intensity of well-prepared octopus.  I wish that the mushroom taco ($10) didn't muddle the huitlacoche, a mushroom that grows on corn that debuts as a salsa rather than a stand-alone delicacy. More mushrooms (maitake, truffle) and more vegetables (Brussels sprouts) and two fats (garlic aioli and oaxaca cheese) are too many ingredients.  For a conservative order, the carnitas taco ($10) is a near classic, with braised pork butt, guacamole, salsa verde, cilantro and irresistible chicharrones. Baja tacos ($12) are also satisfying, stuffed with tempura-battered barramundi and balanced with the crunch of finely chopped white cabbage, onion and radish, the freshness of cilantro and jalapeno relish, and the creamy tang of lime aioli.  Good food, great people watching and a charismatic staff make Tako a seamless experience if you are in the mood for this kind of place. Skip the baseball game, go on an off hour, or sit outside in the rain. In other words, get a seat however you can, at least until the next \"it\" place thins the crowd.",

        "content":"On weekdays, the  <icent id=\"4001025\"> Trâng </icent>  family starts thinking about lunch at 6am.  More specifically, that’s when they begin preparing g à chi ê n mu ô i ot or “fried chicken salt chili,” the popular dish that serves as the cornerstone of the lucrative lunch service they’ve been operating in the 3rd district of  <icent id=\"4000497\"> Ho Chi Minh City </icent>  for three decades.  The family prepares more than 15 distinct dishes daily (plus rice, water-spinach soup, and iced green tea) out of the stall-sized kitchen in their modest three-room apartment. At about 11 am, they lower the goods to the ground floor using a makeshift pulley system, walk less than 100 metres around the corner, and set up shop on a shaded patch of sidewalk next to an electrical transformer. Over the next two hours, a throng of roughly 150 diners – from office workers in suits to motorbike taxi drivers in flip flops – come for lunch, paying 30,000 VND (87 pence) per plate.  The  <icent id=\"4001025\"> Trâng </icent>  family is one of countless informal street food vendors in  <icent id=\"4000242\"> Vietnam </icent> . In  <icent id=\"4000497\"> Ho Chi Minh City </icent> , 11% of the workforce are street vendors, part of the 51% of the total workforce in the city employed in informal, non-agricultural work, according to government-collected data.  However, despite its ubiquity street vending in  <icent id=\"4000242\"> Vietnam </icent>  exists in a grey area. While registration with the government is dependent on surpassing a certain threshold of earnings, a 2014 report on Vietnam’s informal economy by the UN’s International Labour Office estimates that up to 78% of these home-run business operate illegally.  In spite of this legal ambiguity, Vietnamese street food has not just become part of the cultural fabric of  <icent id=\"4000242\"> Vietnam </icent>  , but also a cuisine that’s imitated, fetishised, and replicated in cities all over the western world. In  <icent id=\"4000497\"> Ho Chi Minh City </icent> , there’s a cottage tourism industry around helping westerners find the best street food as well as  <icent id=\"4123010\"> YouTube </icent>  videos and English language blogs providing directions to popular but hard-to-find vendors.  However, amidst Ho Chi Minh City’s increasing luxury stores and air-conditioned shopping malls, it’s easy to overlook the fact that this celebrated and ad-hoc industry is one born squarely out of a lack of economic opportunity and a dearth of jobs in the formal sector.  According to Lisa Barthelmes, a PhD candidate studying Vietnam’s informal economy at Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, Vietnam’s Doi Moi economic liberalisation reforms of the mid 1980s aimed to create a modern country, and thus street vending in the urban realm was seen by the government as “a visible manifestation of backwardness”. But 30 years later, as any pedestrian on Saigon’s teeming sidewalks can see, the industry is far from in decline. Although unregistered street vending is still not sanctioned by the government, Barthelmes explains why it has flourished in spite of economic reform.  “After Doi Moi, rural Vietnamese suddenly needed cash because formerly subsidised state policies like education and  <icent id=\"4260595\"> healthcare </icent>  were abandoned, so they couldn’t live off their farms anymore,” Barthelmes said. “Simultaneously, movement and residency were much less restricted, so all of a sudden the government couldn’t control the rural-urban migration that usually happens when an economy is liberalised.”  The economic challenges of making a living in the informal economy are not uniform among all street vendors. Those familiar with Ho Chi Minh City’s street food economy say it can be broken down unofficially into a three-tiered system. The bottom tier are hyper-mobile street vendors who serve a single dish, carry their wares on their backs as they move around the city, and are often rural-to-urban migrants scraping by on very low earnings.  Related: Price controls and scarcity force  <icent id=\"4264309\"> Venezuelans </icent>  to turn to the  <icent id=\"4259895\"> black market </icent>  for milk and toilet paper  The second tier don’t have a fixed storefront, but they tend to operate in the same spot every day and serve a variety of dishes. The top tier are fixed vendors, usually people who have lived in the city for a long time. They pay rent for or own a brick and mortar storefront, and often live in the same space that they sell.  For the  <icent id=\"4001025\"> Trâng </icent>  family, this second tier has provided a quality of life that’s far above the national average. After expenses, they take in more than $100 per day, which on a yearly basis puts them far above Vietnam’s average per capita GDP, which is less than $2,000 per year. In the absence of formal financial services like loans, they say this level of earnings is enough to provide the capital to hire a new employee and open an additional noodle stand in the near future. Their 31-year-old daughter Thao, who’s began helping out at the family business when she was eight, expresses pride in what she does.  Related: Chicken parties and other ways the world's poorest people raise money  “Of course we are happy that people know about our food,” Thao said. “I studied business administration and thought about working in hospitality, but I like the family aspect of the business and the interaction with people. I couldn’t imagine working in an office.”  Le, 39, is a street vendor who operates on the lowest and most difficult tier. Her very popular soup, bún d ò (red noodles), is a combination of banana leaf wrapped-sausage, cubes of congealed pork blood, morning glory greens, shrimp paste, snails, and tofu, for which she charges about 75 cents per bowl. The informal and improvised nature of her setup seems to enhance its popularity; at rush hour on a Thursday evening in April, her guests include everyone from a businessman in a tailored suit to a  <icent id=\"4122002\"> Pizza Hut </icent>  employee stopping by after her shift just in time to get the dregs of the pot. Patrons squat and slurp on tiny plastic stools behind a bus stop.  In a sense, Le’s is a high-risk, high-reward endeavour. Thanks to serving a somewhat unique regional dish in a highly-trafficked area near a luxury construction project, she sells roughly 200 bowls per day, pulling in a healthy net profit of roughly 1.6 million VND, approximately $75.  However, she says the physical demands of constant food preparation and transporting her setup are punishing. Moreover, she is constantly afraid of being chased away by police, which is part of the reason she did not provide her full name when interviewed. When that happens, Le says it significantly hurts her bottom line.  “I can’t sell enough bowls of soup to break even because I lose too much time.”  Le’s situation is in contrast to Hoa Huynh, a fixed vendor who lives with his family in his shophouse on Cô Giang, a hub of street food in Saigon’s 1st district. His earnings from selling bańh trańh cuôń (rice paper rolls with fat-wrapped beef, rice noodles, vegetables and fresh herbs) are much lower than Le’s, profiting less than £15 per day. Hoa says that because he lacks the literal kerb appeal of vendors such as Le, he has to offer freebies like hand wipes, delivery and free Coca Colas to differentiate himself and lure customers off the street.  However, with his stationary enterprise, he’s able to operate seven days per week, takes on far less risk, and doesn’t have to pay for transportation or lost earnings due to an abandoned post mid-service. Somewhat perversely, locals say a fixed storefront vendor like Hoa is considered at a higher socioeconomic level than a mobile vendor like Le, despite the fact that she earns more profit.  The  <icent id=\"4210127\"> Vietnamese government </icent>  seems aware that this multi-tiered industry is at least in part responsible for keeping Ho Chi Minh City’s employment rate quite low at 3.29%. The government’s 2014 report on the labour force says the this stabilised unemployment rate despite a “low level of development of the economy” could be owed to the harsh reality that “workers must stay employed, even in the informal sector where earnings are low and unstable, in order to support themselves and their family.” Meanwhile, interviews with the ministry of planning and investment, which is responsible for regulation, reveal that the ministry “is aware of this situation but does not seem to consider that addressing this issue should be a priority”, notes the ILO report .  Although earning potential, risks, and status vary widely across Saigon’s street food industry, the biggest indication of how vendors feel about their work comes from asking if they want their children to do the same.  Le, who is illiterate and says she has never contemplated any other profession, knows she is unlikely to find a job in the formal economy. But when asked about her teenage son, who often comes to help her after his studies, she looks up from her near-empty soup cauldron and, for the first time in the evening, seems resolute.  “There is no future for my son if he keeps selling food this way.”  Translation by Phan Trần Hồng Trâm, Nguy ễn Mai Thu Vân, and Vinh Dao  Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.
